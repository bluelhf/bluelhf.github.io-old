Wednesday (or Thursday) coffee at Sammaljoki Church, 20.10.2021, Reijo Telaranta<br/><br/>Don't stop, keep playing!<br/><br/>A mother had taken her son, who had started his own piano lessons, to a concert by a world-famous pianist. When they had entered the concert hall and found their seats, the mother spotted her friends some distance away. She told her son to wait and hurried to greet them. Left alone, the boy found he had a chance to explore. He set off wandering and came to a door with a sign on it: "No entry". The boy decided to see what was behind the mysterious door.<br/><br/>As the lights in the hall dimmed, the mother said goodbye to her acquaintances and hurried to her seat. To her dismay, she discovered that her son had disappeared. At the same moment, the curtain opened. On the stage, in bright light, stood a magnificent black concert grand piano. To her horror, the mother saw her own son sitting at the grand piano, fumbling to play the melody of Für Elise.<br/><br/>At the same moment, a famous pianist walked onto the stage, spotted her son and stepped right up behind him, whispering: "Don't stop. Keep playing!" Next, the pianist, who was standing behind the boy, bent down and reached his left arm over the boy's shoulder and began to add powerful bass chords to the simple melody. After a moment, he reached his right hand over the boy's shoulder as well, bringing a nice flow to the boy's playing.<br/><br/>Together, the internationally renowned master and the young boy, just beginning his piano lessons, turned an awkward and embarrassing situation into a wonderful, unforgettable and brilliantly inspired musical performance. The audience was overwhelmed. Everyone clapped their hands enthusiastically.<br/><br/>God works in the same way as that famous pianist. What we do and what we achieve can be compared to the fumbling of Für Elise by the little boy. What we accomplish is often not very great or even worth mentioning. Even when we try our best, the results tend to be mediocre at best.<br/><br/>But if we allow God to come in and guide us in the way He wants, the result can be something that surprises both ourselves and those around us. In the hands of a great Master, our efforts and fumbling can accomplish a tremendous amount of good. Even something akin to the five loaves and two fish of the little boy in the Bible story, with which Jesus fed five thousand men, plus women and children.<br/><br/>Before the next time you plan, start, or already do a ministry, ask the Great Conductor, the Creator of all, God the Father, to join in the work. Let him be involved in choosing the right mission for you, preparing it and guiding your work. If you then listen carefully, you may hear the Master's voice as he whispers to you with encouragement and encouragement: "Don't stop, keep going!"<br/><br/>Perhaps in those moments you may even feel the Master's arms around you as his strong almighty hands guide, encourage and bless your work. In His blessing hands, the everyday melody of your life can also grow into a concert that will touch and encourage many of those close to you.<br/><br/>The Master is not looking for multi-talented people with many skills. He is looking for ordinary people, people who are ready to accept him as the conductor of their lives and activities. He does not ask us to do something great and wonderful. He himself wants to equip us ordinary people with the skills and talents we need for the task he has given us. <br/><br/>And none of us are without a mission. He has a purpose and a goal for the lives of every unique and greatly loved person He creates. In this time, we get to serve and communicate his love to our fellow human beings. We get to tell them about Jesus, who has paid our sin debt and opened the way for us to the most wonderful goal of all, eternal life together with all our loved ones with our heavenly Father.<br/><br/>Paul sums up the keys to success in a wonderful way in Philippians 4:13:<br/><br/>I can do all things through him who strengthens me. (Phil. 4:13)<br/><br/>God's blessing and peace to you, my dear friend!
